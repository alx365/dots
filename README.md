### THIS HAS MOVED TO MY DOTNIX REPO ###

My stuff stuff like config files, binaries, shellscripts and other stuff i would like to keep for the next time i bork my machine ;)
THis git repo lies in your home directory, so all paths are relative to that.
My username is `legendofmiracles`, so you'll have to change it in all config files, where I can't use relative paths.

My current setup is plain i3, polybar, rofi, doom emacs ***(basically emacs with vim keybinds and ez mode) **and** vim (tho not configured).

You'll also have to syslink the ~/services to /usr/lib/systemd/system in order for systemd to notice them
